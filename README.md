# LavishTea-Sales-Force_Automation-System

Lavish Sales Force Automation System is a group Project which we have done in the second year. Our main objective is to deliver our client a working web based platform for Sales Force Management, that is to maintain their daily sales, keep track of their sales representatives location, manage stocks, and to manage customer deals etc. They will be able to easily manage workers, customers, distributors through our system.
